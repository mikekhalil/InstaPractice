InstaPractice

Tools Used: Yeoman, AngularJS, Creative Tim CSS templates

This is a small AngularJS project to get used to the instagram API.

Since I decided to make this a client side application, I used Implicit Authentication.
While this is not recommended in production applications, I thought it was appropriate for getting used to the InstagramAPI.

As I moved on into the project, I learned a lot about the OAuth 2.0 Protocol, CORS, and the Instagram API.
After learning more about CORS, I learned more about the security threats of why using the Implicit Authentication is so dangerous and why using JSONP is dangerous as well. 

If I were to do this project over again, I would implement a server componenet. However, it was interesting to learn about how it is actually possible to use the InstagramAPI through the client, as well as to learn more about OAuth and CORS.
